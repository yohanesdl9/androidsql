# Android application using MySQL and CodeIgniter (PHP Framework)

This project is an example project of Android application that categorized as client-server database application. Android as a client will be associated with MySQL server with PHP intermediaries, which in this case we use the CodeIgniter framework. This project used as demo app in STIKI (Sekolah Tinggi Informatika dan Komputer Indonesia) Malang Community Meetup 2018 at May 11th, 2018.

In this project, I'm using 3 libraries that I've downloaded from <https://github.com/kosalgeek>, that's GenAsync 1.2, GSON, and KGJSon Converter. With this three libraries, make an Android application with MySQL and CodeIgniter is easier and faster. For more information about this library and it's usage, please visit <https://github.com/kosalgeek>. Also, watch 2 YouTube videos there :
